I have only tracked and pushed code, not data or things generated by said code.

Relevant files:
*correlations.py: calculates correlation and adjacency matrix. Currently trying to get certain functions in this file to run in parallel
*parallelprocessingtest.py: a simplified test of what "correlations.py" should be dong.
*Network Analysis.ipynb: jupyter notebook that contains all of the analysis on the adjacency matricies I am currently doing.

Basically everything else can be ignored as it is either nonsense or old.
